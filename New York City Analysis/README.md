# New York City Analysis

## Project Overview 📊
Welcome to the "New York City Analysis" project, a MySQL-based exploration of data related to New York City. This small project, assigned by my institute, involves fundamental data analysis techniques, including grouping, joins, case statements, data manipulation, and changes.

## Key Steps and Achievements 🚀

### 1. Data Grouping
- **Objective**: Group and aggregate data to derive meaningful insights.
- **Approach**: Utilized GROUP BY clause in SQL queries for aggregating data based on specific criteria.

### 2. Table Joins
- **Objective**: Combine data from different tables for comprehensive analysis.
- **Approach**: Employed SQL JOIN operations to merge relevant information from multiple sources.

### 3. Case Statements
- **Objective**: Implement conditional logic for data categorization and analysis.
- **Approach**: Leveraged SQL CASE statements to perform conditional evaluations on the dataset.

### 4. Data Manipulation
- **Objective**: Manipulate data to prepare it for further analysis.
- **Approach**: Executed SQL queries to perform data manipulation tasks, ensuring data quality and relevance.

### 5. Changes in Data
- **Objective**: Track and analyze changes in the dataset over time.
- **Approach**: Applied SQL queries to detect and analyze modifications, additions, or deletions in the data.

## Tools and Technologies 🛠️
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Query Language**: SQL
