# Big Mart Sales Analysis

## Project Overview 📊
Welcome to the "Big Mart Sales Analysis" project, a hands-on exploration of sales data using MySQL techniques. This small project, assigned by my institute, involves fundamental data fetching, joins, subqueries, and advanced data analysis on the Big Mart database to extract valuable insights.

## Key Steps and Achievements 🚀

### 1. Data Fetching
- **Objective**: Retrieve essential data from the Big Mart database.
- **Approach**: Implemented basic SQL queries for data extraction.

### 2. Table Joins
- **Objective**: Combine data from different tables for a holistic view.
- **Approach**: Utilized SQL JOIN operations to merge relevant information.

### 3. Subqueries
- **Objective**: Leverage subqueries for nested data retrieval.
- **Approach**: Implemented subqueries to obtain specific subsets of data.

### 4. Grouping and Filtering
- **Objective**: Group and filter data to derive meaningful insights.
- **Approach**: Employed GROUP BY and HAVING clauses for aggregation and filtering.

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Objective**: Conducted exploratory analysis for deeper insights.
- **Approach**: Applied advanced SQL queries, including aggregations and statistical measures.

## Tools and Technologies 🛠️
